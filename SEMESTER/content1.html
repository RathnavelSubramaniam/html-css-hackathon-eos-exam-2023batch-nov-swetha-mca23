			<h2>HISTORY OF CRICKET</h2>	
			<article>

				<p>
                    There is a consensus of expert opinion that cricket may have been invented during
                    Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands
                    and clearings in south-east England. The first reference to cricket being played
                    as an adult sport was in 1611, and in the same year, a dictionary defined cricket 
                    as a boys' game. There is also the thought that cricket may have derived from bowls,
                    by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target
                    by hitting it away.</p>

                <p>Village cricket had developed by the middle of the 17th century and the first English
                 “county teams” were formed in the second half of the century, as “local experts” from 
                 village cricket were employed as the earliest professionals. The first known game in 
                 which the teams use county names is in 1709. 
				</p>
				<p>
                    In the first half of the 18th Century cricket established itself as a leading sport 
                    in London and the south-eastern counties of England. Its spread was limited by the 
                    constraints of travel, but it was slowly gaining popularity in other parts of England
                 and Women Cricket dates back to the 1745, when the first known match was played in Surrey.
				</p>
				<p>
                    In 1744, the first Laws of Cricket were written and subsequently amended in 1774,
                    when innovations such as lbw, a 3rd stump, - the middle stump and a maximum bat
                    width were added. The codes were drawn up by the “Star and Garter Club” whose 
                    members ultimately founded the famous Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1787.
                     MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made revisions ever 
                    since then to the current day.</p>
