			<h2>CRICKET</h2>
			<p>cricket, England national summer sport, which is now played throughout the world, 
                particularly in Australia, India, Pakistan, the West Indies, and the British Isles.
                Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of
                 11 players. The field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the 
                 pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. Two sets of
                  three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch.
                 Across the top of each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails</p>
